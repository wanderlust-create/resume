### About

I’m the kind of person who carries logic puzzles in my bag and gets excited when something breaks, because it means I get to fix it. Before I started coding, I worked around the world in roles that taught me to listen closely, adapt quickly, and think in systems. I managed finance at Merrill Lynch, supported leprosy-affected communities in India, and taught science in Mexico and China. Now I build backend systems in Python, TypeScript, and Ruby, contribute to civic tech projects, and create APIs and pipelines that turn messy data into clean, usable formats. I’m currently growing my cloud and DevOps skills while preparing for the AWS Developer Associate exam.
